# Sorting

This project showcases the implementation of various sorting algorithms in Python, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and comparing their performance and behavior. The sorting.py script includes several commonly used sorting techniques, useful for educational purposes and practical applications.

Project Structure

sorting.py: The main Python script containing the implementations of various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Features

Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm with quadratic time complexity.
Insertion Sort: Efficient for small data sets, with linear time complexity for nearly sorted data.
Selection Sort: Sorts by repeatedly selecting the minimum element and placing it in the correct position.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.
Quick Sort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the array and has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
